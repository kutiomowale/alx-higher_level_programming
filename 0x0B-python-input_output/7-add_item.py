"""Load, add, save

A script that adds all arguments to a Python list,
and then saves the list to a file:

It uses the function save_to_json_file defined in 5-save_to_json_file.py
And the function load_from_json_file defined in 6-load_from_json_file.py
The list is saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json
The file is created if it doesnâ€™t exist
File permissions / exceptions are not managed
